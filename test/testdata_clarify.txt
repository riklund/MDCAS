This summarizes the current test cases (12):
#0 Passing through BSP only, no scintillator.
#1 Passing through FSP only, no scintillator.
#2 Passing through FSP and BSP, no scintillator.
#3 Passing through FSP, scintillator and BSP.
#4 Implant in scintillator 40.
#5 Decay in scintillator 10, no detected gamma.
#6 Decay in scintillator 40, no detected gamma.
#7 Implant in scintillator 20.
#8 Implant in scintillator 10.
#9 Implant in scintillator 20.
#10 Decay in scintillator 10, detected gamma. ->coincidence.
#11 Decay in scintillator 20, detected gamma. ->double implant, no coincidence, also causes non-association of course.
